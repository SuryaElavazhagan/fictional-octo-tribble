# fictional-octo-tribble

I love problem solving. This repo contains all my solutions to leetcode, hackerrank and some of the solutions are from my university practice questions which I find interesting.

### And regarding the repo name
I really don't know what to name this so I randomly picked a name, I always wondered why github suggests repository name. But finally, It helped. If anyone has a better name suggestions, my DM is always open.

PS: I was curious to know what fictional-octo-tribble means. So I did a little bit of a research.
[Tribble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribble) is a fictional alien character from Star Trek.
To quote from the [fandom site](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tribble)
```
Tribbles are made from a piece of "figure-eight shaped" fake fur, sewn up to make a ball about five inches in diameter
```
Here eight can mean octo. Thus the name (And it is my theory, I don't know the actual meaning yet!).
